  <h1>Upskilling in Disability Support: Pathways to Grow Your Career</h1>

  <p>Working in disability support is more than a job—it’s a chance to make a real difference in people’s lives. As the sector continues to grow, there are more opportunities than ever to advance your career through upskilling. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, investing in your skills can open doors to new roles, better pay, and increased job satisfaction.</p>

  <h2>Why Upskilling Matters in Disability Support</h2>

  <p>Disability support work is a dynamic field that requires empathy, resilience, and a broad skill set. Upskilling helps you stay current with best practices and meet the needs of the people you support. It also demonstrates initiative to employers and can give you a competitive edge when applying for new roles.</p>

  <h2>Top Ways to Upskill</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Short Courses:</strong> Consider completing courses in person-centred care, mental health, or positive behaviour support.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate IV in Disability:</strong> If you already hold a Certificate III, this advanced qualification is a logical next step.</li>
    <li><strong>NDIS-Specific Training:</strong> The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission offers free modules and resources for support workers.</li>
    <li><strong>On-the-Job Learning:</strong> Ask your employer about mentoring, job shadowing, or in-house training opportunities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where to Find Courses</h2>

  <p>TAFEs, RTOs (Registered Training Organisations), and online platforms like Open Colleges or FutureLearn offer a wide range of training options. Many are flexible to suit shift work schedules.</p>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re employed, ask your manager whether professional development support is available. Some employers fund training or offer study leave.</p>
