        <p>Preparing for a job interview as a disability support worker? Whether you're new to the field or looking to advance your career, knowing what to expect can help you feel more confident and ready to impress. Here's a guide to the most common interview questions in the disability support sector â€” and how to answer them effectively.</p>

        <h2>1. Why do you want to work as a disability support worker?</h2>
        <p>This question is designed to gauge your motivation and values. Employers want to know that you're committed to making a difference and not just looking for any job.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Share a personal story or passion that connects you to the care sector, and highlight your desire to help people live more independently and with dignity.</p>

        <h2>2. How would you handle a situation where a client is becoming agitated or distressed?</h2>
        <p>This tests your emotional intelligence and problem-solving skills. Interviewers want to know that you can stay calm and respond appropriately under pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Explain how you'd use communication techniques, give the person space if needed, and follow any behaviour support plans in place. Always emphasise respect and safety.</p>

        <h2>3. Can you describe a time when you worked as part of a team?</h2>
        <p>Support work often involves collaboration with families, other carers, or allied health professionals. This question checks your teamwork and communication skills.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe a real-life example where you worked effectively with others to support a client.</p>

        <h2>4. What do you understand about person-centred care?</h2>
        <p>This is a key principle in disability support. Employers want to know you prioritise the individual's needs, choices, and goals.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Explain that person-centred care means tailoring your support to each person, involving them in decisions, and helping them build independence and confidence.</p>

        <h2>5. Do you have experience with manual handling or using mobility aids?</h2>
        <p>If the role involves physical support, the employer needs to know you're trained or comfortable with these tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you have formal training, mention it. If not, express a willingness to learn and follow proper procedures for safety.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Interviews can be nerve-wracking, but being prepared makes all the difference. Practise your answers, stay calm, and remember that authenticity matters. The best disability support workers lead with empathy, patience, and a genuine desire to help.</p>
