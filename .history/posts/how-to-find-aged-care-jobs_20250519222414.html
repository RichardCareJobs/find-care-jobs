    <h1>How to Find Aged Care Jobs Near You</h1>
    <p><em>Published 04 May 2025</em></p>

    <p>Aged care workers are in high demand across Australia, and many employers are actively hiring in local communities. Whether you're looking for full-time, part-time, or casual work, there are several practical ways to find aged care jobs near you.</p>

    <h2>1. Use a Care-Focused Job Board</h2>
    <p>Specialised platforms like <strong>Find Care Jobs</strong> can help you find aged care roles tailored to your location and skill set. These platforms list direct employer jobs—not just reposts from other job boards—so you can apply with confidence.</p>

    <h2>2. Search by Suburb or Region</h2>
    <p>Use job filters to search by your suburb, postcode, or a wider region. If you're open to travel, consider looking in surrounding areas where demand may be higher or where there are fewer applicants.</p>

    <h2>3. Apply Directly on Employer Websites</h2>
    <p>Many aged care providers post vacancies on their own websites. Larger organisations like Uniting Care, HammondCare, and Whiddon often have dedicated careers pages with regularly updated listings.</p>

    <h2>4. Register with Local Aged Care Services</h2>
    <p>Some smaller aged care facilities may not advertise online but keep a list of interested applicants. Reach out directly to introduce yourself, drop off a resume, or enquire about upcoming roles.</p>

    <h2>5. Use Your Network</h2>
    <p>Let friends, family, and former colleagues know you're looking for work in aged care. Personal referrals can often lead to interviews and help you stand out from other applicants.</p>

    <p>With a combination of targeted searching and direct contact with care providers, you'll increase your chances of finding meaningful aged care work in your local area.</p>
