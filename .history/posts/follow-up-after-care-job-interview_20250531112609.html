    <h1>How to Follow Up After a Job Interview in the Care Industry</h1>
    <p><em>Published 17 May 2025</em></p>
    <p>You’ve had your interview—now what? Following up after a care sector job interview shows professionalism and helps reinforce your interest in the role. Here’s how to do it the right way.</p>
    <h2>1. Send a Thank-You Email</h2>
    <p>Within 24 hours, send a brief email thanking the interviewer for their time. Reiterate your interest in the role and highlight one thing you particularly connected with during the interview.</p>
    <h2>2. Be Polite and Patient</h2>
    <p>Recruitment processes in aged care and disability support can take time. Avoid following up too soon or repeatedly—this may come across as pushy.</p>
    <h2>3. Ask About the Timeline</h2>
    <p>If you didn’t ask in the interview, it’s okay to include a sentence in your follow-up asking when you can expect to hear back.</p>
    <p>Following up professionally keeps you top of mind and leaves a positive impression—even if you're not successful this time.</p>
