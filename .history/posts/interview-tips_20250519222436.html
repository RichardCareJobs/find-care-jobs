    <h1>Top Interview Tips for Disability Support Work</h1>
    <p><em>Published 03 May 2025</em></p>

    <p>Interviews for disability support roles are not only about your qualifications—they’re about who you are, how you communicate, and how you connect with people. Below are some practical tips to help you stand out and show potential employers that you're the right fit for the role.</p>

    <h2>1. Understand the Role and the Organisation</h2>
    <p>Before the interview, take time to research the employer—understand their values, the types of clients they support, and the services they provide. This helps you align your answers with their expectations and show genuine interest in their work.</p>

    <h2>2. Be Ready to Discuss Real Situations</h2>
    <p>Employers often ask scenario-based questions. Prepare examples from past jobs or life experiences that show how you’ve supported others, handled challenges, or worked as part of a team.</p>

    <h2>3. Highlight Soft Skills</h2>
    <p>While technical knowledge is important, soft skills like empathy, patience, and communication are essential in disability support. Mention specific moments where you demonstrated these qualities.</p>

    <h2>4. Prepare Questions to Ask Them</h2>
    <p>Asking thoughtful questions shows initiative and interest. You could ask about training opportunities, support for new staff, or how the organisation measures success in its care services.</p>

    <h2>5. Dress Neatly and Be On Time</h2>
    <p>First impressions matter. Arrive on time, dress professionally, and bring a copy of your resume—even if they've already seen it.</p>

    <h2>6. Follow Up with Gratitude</h2>
    <p>After the interview, consider sending a short thank-you email. It’s a polite gesture and can leave a lasting positive impression.</p>

    <p>With preparation, authenticity, and a clear understanding of the role, you'll be well on your way to securing your next opportunity in disability support.</p>
