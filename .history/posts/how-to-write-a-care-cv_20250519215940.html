    <h1>How to Write a Great CV for Aged Care Jobs</h1>
    <p><em>Published 19 May 2025</em></p>

    <p>If you're applying for jobs in aged care, your CV is one of the most important tools you have to make a strong first impression. Employers in the care sector are looking for people who not only have the right qualifications, but who also demonstrate empathy, reliability, and a genuine desire to support others. Here's how to write a CV that showcases those qualities.</p>

    <h2>1. Start with a Clear and Relevant Summary</h2>
    <p>Open with a short personal statement that highlights your experience and commitment to aged care. This should be tailored to the role you're applying for and mention key attributes like compassion, patience, and professionalism.</p>

    <h2>2. Focus on Practical Experience</h2>
    <p>Employers value hands-on experience. Whether you've worked in residential care, home support, or as a volunteer, include details about the type of care you provided, the people you supported, and the outcomes you achieved.</p>

    <h2>3. List Relevant Qualifications and Training</h2>
    <p>Include your Certificate III or IV in Individual Support or Aged Care, plus any additional training such as first aid, dementia care, or manual handling. If you're currently studying, mention your expected completion date.</p>

    <h2>4. Highlight Soft Skills</h2>
    <p>Interpersonal skills are just as important as formal qualifications. Use examples to show how you've communicated effectively with clients, families, or colleagues, and how you've adapted to different situations with empathy and care.</p>

    <h2>5. Keep the Layout Simple and Professional</h2>
    <p>Use clear headings, bullet points, and easy-to-read fonts. Avoid clutter or overly creative designs—employers in aged care appreciate a CV that’s clean and easy to scan quickly.</p>

    <h2>6. Tailor Your CV for Each Role</h2>
    <p>Adjust your CV to reflect the specific duties and requirements listed in the job ad. This shows attention to detail and helps your application stand out in the early screening stages.</p>

    <p>By presenting your experience clearly and aligning it with what aged care employers are looking for, your CV can open the door to meaningful work supporting older Australians.</p>
