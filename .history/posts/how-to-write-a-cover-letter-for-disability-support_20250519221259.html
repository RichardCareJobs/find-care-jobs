    <h1>How to Write a Cover Letter for Disability Support Work</h1>
    <p><em>Published 13 May 2025</em></p>
    <p>Your cover letter is a chance to speak directly to an employer and show them why you're a great fit. In disability support, it's your opportunity to highlight your compassion, communication skills, and dedication to person-centred care.</p>
    <h2>1. Start Strong</h2>
    <p>Open with a clear statement of your interest in the role and where you saw the job advertised. Mention the organisation by name to show you've done your research.</p>
    <h2>2. Align with the Role</h2>
    <p>Explain how your skills and experience match what the employer is looking for. Use keywords from the job ad where appropriate.</p>
    <h2>3. Show Your Passion</h2>
    <p>Briefly explain why you enjoy working in disability support. A short story or example can help show your motivation and values.</p>
    <h2>4. Keep it Concise</h2>
    <p>Stick to one page. Employers are often busyâ€”make it easy for them to see your suitability quickly.</p>
    <p>End with a thank you and a call to action, such as expressing your interest in an interview. Sign off professionally with your name and contact details.</p>
