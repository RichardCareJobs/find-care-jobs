    <h1>How to Prepare for Your First Job in Aged Care</h1>
    <p><em>Published 10 May 2025</em></p>
    <p>Starting a new job in aged care is both exciting and nerve-wracking. You’ll be supporting people with complex needs and making a genuine difference in their lives. Here’s how to prepare for your first day.</p>
    <h2>1. Understand Your Role</h2>
    <p>Revisit the job description and familiarise yourself with the duties, expectations, and values of the organisation. Know who you’ll be reporting to and what your shift patterns might look like.</p>
    <h2>2. Review Your Training</h2>
    <p>If you’ve recently completed a Certificate III or IV, review your notes and key practices. Make sure you’re confident in manual handling, hygiene protocols, and client dignity.</p>
    <h2>3. Prepare Your Uniform and Documents</h2>
    <p>Ensure your work clothes (if required) are clean and presentable. Bring your ID, any certification copies, and other required paperwork.</p>
    <h2>4. Keep an Open Mind</h2>
    <p>Your first few shifts may be overwhelming. Ask questions, be polite, and show willingness to learn. Supervisors understand you’re new—attitude and effort go a long way.</p>
    <p>Being prepared and positive will help you build confidence and get the most out of your first aged care role.</p>
