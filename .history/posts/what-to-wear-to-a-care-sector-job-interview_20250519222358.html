    <h1>What to Wear to a Care Sector Job Interview</h1>
    <p><em>Published 06 May 2025</em></p>

    <p>First impressions count, and what you wear to a job interview in aged care or disability support can make a difference. While you don’t need to wear a suit or spend money on new clothes, it’s important to look professional, clean, and approachable.</p>

    <h2>1. Aim for Neat and Tidy, Not Overdressed</h2>
    <p>Choose clothing that’s clean, well-fitted, and free of rips, stains, or excessive logos. Smart casual is a good benchmark—think neat pants or a skirt with a plain shirt or blouse. Avoid wearing anything too flashy or too casual, like ripped jeans or graphic tees.</p>

    <h2>2. Wear Comfortable, Closed-Toe Shoes</h2>
    <p>Especially in care roles where you'll be on your feet, employers will appreciate practical footwear. You don’t need dress shoes, but avoid thongs, sandals, or old runners.</p>

    <h2>3. Keep Hair and Grooming Professional</h2>
    <p>Make sure your hair is clean and tidy. Facial hair should be groomed, and makeup (if worn) should be subtle. Strong perfumes or colognes should be avoided in case your interviewer or future clients are sensitive to smells.</p>

    <h2>4. Choose Practical Accessories</h2>
    <p>If you wear jewellery, keep it simple. A watch or small earrings are fine, but avoid anything that could get in the way or appear distracting.</p>

    <h2>5. Let Your Personality Show—Gently</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to hide your style completely. A bit of colour or a neat accessory can help express who you are—just be sure it supports the professional, caring image you want to present.</p>

    <p>In care sector interviews, your attitude and presentation matter just as much as your qualifications. Dressing appropriately shows respect for the role and the people you'll be supporting.</p>
