  <h1>Upskilling in Aged Care: How to Advance Your Career and Make a Bigger Impact</h1>

  <p><em>Published 28 May 2025</em></p>

  <p>Australia’s ageing population is driving demand for skilled aged care workers. Upskilling is not only a smart move for career progression—it’s also essential for delivering high-quality care in an evolving sector. Whether you're aiming to take on more responsibility or specialise in a particular area, there are many ways to build your skills.</p>

  <h2>Popular Upskilling Pathways in Aged Care</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Certificate IV in Ageing Support:</strong> This builds on a Certificate III and is often required for team leader or supervisory roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Medication Administration Courses:</strong> These short courses can enable you to safely administer medications under supervision.</li>
    <li><strong>Dementia and Palliative Care Training:</strong> With increasing demand for specialist care, training in these areas is highly valuable.</li>
    <li><strong>Leadership and Management Qualifications:</strong> If you're ready to step into a coordinator or facility manager role, consider a Diploma of Leadership and Management.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Get Started</h2>

  <p>Many TAFEs and RTOs offer flexible delivery modes, including part-time, online, and evening classes. If you’re working in aged care already, speak with your employer about training subsidies or internal development programs.</p>

  <h2>Did You Know?</h2>

  <p>Upskilling can make you eligible for higher-paying roles and increase your confidence when applying for new jobs. It’s also a great way to stay engaged and avoid burnout by bringing new meaning and challenge to your work.</p>
