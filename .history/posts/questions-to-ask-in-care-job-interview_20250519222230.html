    <h1>Questions to Ask in a Care Sector Job Interview</h1>
    <p><em>Published 12 May 2025</em></p>
    <p>Interviews are a two-way conversation. Asking thoughtful questions at the end of your interview shows initiative and helps you understand if the role is right for you.</p>
    <h2>1. What support do you offer for new staff?</h2>
    <p>This helps you understand if you’ll receive proper onboarding or mentorship when starting the role.</p>
    <h2>2. What does a typical day in this role look like?</h2>
    <p>It gives you insight into responsibilities and helps you decide if the environment suits your skills and availability.</p>
    <h2>3. How do you support staff wellbeing?</h2>
    <p>In care roles, emotional resilience is important. A good employer will have policies in place to support mental health and wellbeing.</p>
    <h2>4. What are the next steps in the recruitment process?</h2>
    <p>This shows confidence and helps you know what to expect after the interview.</p>
    <p>Asking questions is a great way to leave a strong final impression—just make sure they're relevant, respectful, and sincere.</p>
