  <h1>Work-Related Tax Deductions for Aged Care and Disability Support Workers in Australia</h1>

  <p><em>Published 31 May 2025</em></p>

  <p>If you work in aged care or disability support, you may be entitled to claim a range of tax deductions to help reduce your taxable income. Knowing what you can and can’t claim can make a big difference at tax time.</p>

  <h2>Common Deductible Expenses</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Uniform and Laundry:</strong> Branded or compulsory uniforms and associated laundry costs are usually deductible.</li>
    <li><strong>Work-Related Travel:</strong> If you travel between clients, you can often claim vehicle expenses (or a cents-per-kilometre rate), public transport fares, and tolls.</li>
    <li><strong>Training and Education:</strong> Courses directly related to your job, including first aid or Certificate IV upgrades, are typically deductible if not reimbursed by your employer.</li>
    <li><strong>Union and Membership Fees:</strong> Professional association fees or union dues can also be claimed.</li>
    <li><strong>Work Equipment:</strong> Items such as a diary, work bag, PPE (like gloves or masks), or a phone used for work-related calls may be partially deductible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Important Things to Remember</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Keep detailed records and receipts for all deductions.</li>
    <li>Home-to-work travel is generally not claimable, but travel between workplaces is.</li>
    <li>If you’re unsure, consult a registered tax agent or refer to the ATO’s guides for aged care and support workers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The ATO’s occupation-specific guides are a great resource and can help ensure you’re not missing out on legitimate claims.</p>
