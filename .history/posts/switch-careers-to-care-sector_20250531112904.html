    <h1>How to Switch Careers into the Care Sector</h1>
    <p><em>Published 19 May 2025</em></p>
    <p>The care sector is one of Australia's fastest-growing industries, and many people are making the switch from other fields. If you're considering a career change into aged care or disability support, here’s how to get started.</p>
    <h2>1. Identify Transferable Skills</h2>
    <p>Skills like communication, teamwork, time management, and problem-solving are all highly valued in care roles—even if gained in a different industry.</p>
    <h2>2. Explore Training Options</h2>
    <p>Consider enrolling in a Certificate III or IV in Individual Support. Some courses can be completed part-time or online and may include work placements.</p>
    <h2>3. Try Volunteering</h2>
    <p>Volunteering in a care setting can help you build confidence, gain experience, and decide whether the sector is the right fit for you.</p>
    <h2>4. Tailor Your Applications</h2>
    <p>When applying for entry-level roles, explain why you’re passionate about making the switch and how your background brings value to the team.</p>
    <p>Switching careers takes courage, but the care industry welcomes people with heart, commitment, and the right mindset.</p>
